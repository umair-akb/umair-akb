Hi 👋 I'm Umair. My initials are USA.

A brief overview of what I do:
### Cloud Engineering 
* I am a Cloud Native Infrastructure Engineer and DevOps Professional. I have a deep understanding of Infrastructure Automation, Cloud Architecture, and Public/Private Cloud Provisioning. My experience includes being as both the admin and developer for private clouds, scaling up infrastructure to meet diverse needs while ensuring compliance with enterprise policies, automation of infrastructure operations using open source toolsets such as Ansible, Terraform, Packer and Puppet.
* I work with Cloud and Infrastructure as Code (Iac), this includes **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, and **Microsoft Azure**

### Security Systems Engineer
* I architect cloud-based systems that are based on these tenets: 
   * **Resiliency** - If something "goes wrong" in the code; the program is able to self-heal or continue without affecting the entire system itself.
   * **Highly-available** - The system is *ideally* available at all times; the system converges towards an error-free state and is therefore self stabilizing.
   * **Redundancy** - There will always be multiple identical instances of the system and it will switch to one of the redundant instances in case of failover.
   * **Efficiency** - The above three cost a lot to achieve; my designs are extremely efficient. If there is too much code, complexity, both, or either, I will revert the changes and re-create the system until it is. Being efficient and having all three of the above is a requirement. Until that is achieved my work is not complete.
